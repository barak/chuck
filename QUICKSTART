what is it: ChucK is a general-purpose programming language, intended 
for real-time audio synthesis and graphics/multimedia programming. It 
introduces a truly concurrent programming model that embeds timing 
directly in the program flow.  Other potentially useful features
include the ability to write/change programs on-the-fly.

who it's for: audio/multimedia researchers, developers, composers, and 
performers

what this distribution includes:
  - source for ChucK (compiler, virtual machine, synthesis engine)
  - examples
  - license + release notes

supported platforms:
  - macOS (CoreAudio)
  - Linux (ALSA/Pulse/JACK)
  - Windows (DirectSound/WASAPI/ASIO)
